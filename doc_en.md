## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Distribution of key variables (age, seniority, department, salary, etc.)
- Correlation analysis
- Visualization of key insights (histograms, bar charts, pie charts, line plots, scatter plots)
- Comparisons between satisfied and unsatisfied employees
- Classification of employees by generation (Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z)
- Comparisons focused on gender and age

---

## ü§î Visual Analysis

### 1. Analysis Focus

The initial scope of the project focuses on **identifying key patterns and factors** related to employee satisfaction and turnover. An exploratory and descriptive approach based on visualizations and correlation analysis was chosen. The analysis centers on identifying trends by age and gender within ABC Corporation, aiming to determine whether equality is a key factor in job satisfaction.

### 2. Main Visualizations Generated

- Job satisfaction distribution by department, age, salary level, and gender
- Identification of roles with the lowest satisfaction
- Identification of age groups at higher risk of attrition or low satisfaction
- Comparison of salary levels by gender and age

### 3. Key Insights

![Employees by gender](img/empleados_genero.png)

Based on data analysis, visualizations, and key comparisons, several relevant factors were identified that may directly influence job satisfaction and talent retention within the company:

- **Generational composition**: A clear majority of *Millennials*, fewer *Baby Boomers*. *Gen X* is evenly distributed. Leadership is dominated by older generations due to tenure and experience.

- **Salary analysis**: Higher salaries for those with doctoral degrees, especially *Gen X*. *Gen Z* doesn't follow this pattern. No clear relationship between salary and job satisfaction.

- **Role distribution**: *Millennials* in diverse roles; *Gen X* and *Baby Boomers* in leadership. Indicates potential **promotion barriers** for younger generations.

- **Job satisfaction**: Generally positive. *Baby Boomers* more dissatisfied, *Millennials* most satisfied, *Gen X* shows polarization. Specific roles (Sales Executives, Laboratory Technicians, HR) with lower satisfaction.

- **Gender insights**: Women are the majority and present in senior roles, but **men earn higher salaries**, especially with higher education. Recommends reviewing equity policies to address hidden disparities.

## üìå Conclusions and Recommendations

### üìå Key Analysis Conclusions

- **Generational distribution** confirms a *Millennial* majority; *Baby Boomers* lead leadership roles.

- **No direct correlation between salary and job satisfaction** found despite education or age.

- **Promotion programs** recommended for *Millennials* and *Gen Z* into leadership roles.

- **Job satisfaction** differs by generation and role. Key improvement areas include:
  - *Baby Boomers*: more dissatisfaction
  - *Millennials*: more satisfied
  - *Gen X*: polarized responses
  - Roles: *Sales Executives*, *Lab Technicians*, *HR* departments

- **Gender analysis**: salary gap in favor of men despite women's leadership presence. Suggests **policy review for equity**.
